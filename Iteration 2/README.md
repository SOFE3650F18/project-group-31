### Step 2: Establish a goal 

The goal of this iteration is to achieve architectural concern CNR-2. This will involve designing the front-end of the system. Related artifacts are chosen as the drivers,even though all Quality Attributes, Use Cases and Concerns should be taken into consideration.Namely, the following are going to be focused on:

- QA-2 (Usability)
- QA-3 (Performance)
- QA-6 (Security)
- QA-7 (Interoperability)
- CNR-2
- CON-1
- CON-2

### Step 3: Choose 1 or more elements of the system to decompose

This is a specific development effort for the client-side module of the deployable application. As such, the element to refine is the Client-Side Application (or the front-end). Refinement is performed through decomposition.
